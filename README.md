## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

The most importent criteria are:
1. Navigation: Built navigation dynamically as an unordered list, using Append, appendChild and innerHTML methods.

2. Section Active State: It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

3. Scroll to Anchor: When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
